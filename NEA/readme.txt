Hello!
I'm doing computer science GCSE and I have an NEA coming up.
An NEA is basically like this assessment we do where we have to make some code given a brief, and it counts as part of our coursework.
To practise, we were given a library brief.
I've uploaded my code for it here to expand my portfolio and show that I'm still working on things.
I am also meant to annotate it but I will do that later.
This took me ages so I'm very happy its done :)
